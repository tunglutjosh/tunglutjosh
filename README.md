👋 Hi, I'm Joshua Tunglut! A Computer Science and Engineering Graduate looking to make a name in the Data Engineering field.

## About Me

With a passion for creativity, I often bring my creative thinking skills to solve technical problems in ways that most people would'nt. I truly believe imagination is the source of innovation, and if you can visualise it you can materialise it. Having written critical reviews and analysis on my Social Media Page for art and other artistic medium like games, I tend to bring in my critical analytical skills whenever building a project or debugging errors. I want to be able to help society on a big or small scale and build non-commercialised projects that would help, most desireably, the small-scale business sector.
